# PRX Feeder Viewer

Fetch and display data from the PRX Feeder API.

## Setup

1. Make sure you've told PRX you're working on this project, so we can make you
   a private repo to Pull Request against!
2. Checkout a new git branch to work from
3. Install some version of NodeJS >= 10.0.0
4. Run `npm start`
5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
6. Code away!
7. Commit your changes, and open a Github Pull Request

## Tasks

I've done a terrible job writing this app, and the PRX CTO is furious.
He has called me names, and questioned my lunch choices.
While I'm sobbing under my desk, pick a few tasks to make things better.

These are in no particular order, so feel free to pick a variety that
demonstrate your breadth and depth of skillz.

- [ ] Add the episode descriptions to the page
- [ ] Link to the episode urls
- [ ] Implement some paging, so we can load more episodes
- [ ] Display the episode itunes image
- [ ] Add an audio player to playback the first media for each episode
- [ ] Add a new page to display podcasts, using the links to each podcast
- [ ] Style is important. Add style.
- [ ] Any other fun things you want to do with the data!

You can feel free to add external javascript/css libraries, but this is all very
accomplishable in vanilla js/css. So don't go too overboard! And be sure to keep
your time on this project under a few hours.

After opening your PR, you should be prepared to talk about the changes/choices you
made, and speculate on other iterative improvements to the app.
