# Podcast Title Fun

A series of challenges, manipulating podcast titles in your web browser.

## Setup

1. Make sure you've told PRX you're working on this project, so we can make you
   a private repo to Pull Request against!
2. Checkout a new git branch to work from
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser
4. Code away! Refresh your browser to re-run tests.
5. Commit your changes, and open a Github Pull Request

## Tasks

This project runs on the [MochaJS](https://mochajs.org/#running-mocha-in-the-browser)
test framework, right in your browser!

Unit tests are (mostly) already written for you. These define the expected behaviours
in code - you just need to implement the functions in `challenge_functions.js` to
make them work!

Notes:

- Start by trying to get the first tests in the `test.*.js` files passing. Then
  tackle the incrementally-harder later tests.
- Finish as many tests as you can complete within the time limit. You don't need to
  complete everything in here.
- Optionally tackle the BONUS tests, by changing the `it.skip(` to just `it(` in the tests.
- Feel free to make use of any javascript built-in functions/objects. Or even implement your
  owner helper classes. But avoid adding any 3rd-party libraries for this project.
